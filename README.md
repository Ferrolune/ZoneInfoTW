WIP

Addon for Turtle WOW that aims to add accurate level ranges and factions for all zones, towns, cities, and point of interests.
The closest addon to this is combination of cartographer and handynotes except this is just even more degenerate.

Basic level ranges and zone/town/city data is added so it's fully usable for that purpose.
POI is the current WIP before we're adding anything else. Should take a month before our research is done.


Roadmap

1. POI data
2. Dungeons/Raids/PvP entrances
3. World bosses
4. World buffs
5. Profession trainers
6. Transportation locations (flight masters, zeppelin, boats, portals, translocation orbs, goblin teleporters, etc)
7. Maplinks
8. Innkeepers
9. Guild Houses
10. Optimizations
11. Whatever else I feel like adding.

Currently, contributions, pull requests, and issues are ignored until this roadmap is done. There's a lot of data and exploration to cover before it's done.


Classifications

Zones
  Green = safe for your faction
  Yellow = unsafe for both factions
  Red = unsafe for your faction
  
Cities/Towns
  creatures found here are
    Green = friendly faction-alignment
    Yellow = neutral faction-alignment
    Red = hostile faction-alignment
  POI follows the same coloring as cities/towns, except they're referring to the monsters in the area with the exception that if the POI is obviously a faction-area then it'll override anything else found in the area (E.G. Ridgepoint Tower)

Level Ranges, distance from current level to lowest level in the range.
  +10 (Black)
  +5  (Red)
  +3  (Orange)
  -2  (Yellow)
  -5  (Green)
  -6 or less (Gray)
